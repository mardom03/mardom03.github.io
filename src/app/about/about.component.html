    <h1 class="text-center">About Me</h1>
    <div class="container mt-5">
        <p>
            I am a student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, pursuing a double major in
            Computer Science and Mathematics with an expected graduation year of 2025.
            As a member of the Delta Chi Fraternity, I hold the position of community service director,
            where I have successfully organized meaningful events in collaboration with local food banks
            and nature preserves to positively impact our community. I am also a co-director of Humorology,
            UW-Madison's annual philanthropic theater performance, which aims to raise funds for
            child abuse treatment and prevention. In my precious little remaining free time I enjoy weightlifting, sailing, and
            reading.

            I have a strong background in software development, stemming from high school when I first delved into Java and Python. 
            Since then, I have been continuously expanding my knowledge through classes and personal projects. 
            I also familiarized myself with Linux and gained a solid foundation in web development using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

            In college, I further honed my skills by working extensively with Java in my introductory courses. 
            As I progressed to classes in computer architecture and operating systems, I used C to create caching systems, 
            RPC wrappers, and file system scanners. Working towards my math major, I have taken classes in differential equations, linear algebra,
            combinatorics, and real analysis.

            Over a year ago, I began an exciting opportunity as a DevOps intern at Skyward Inc, 
            a Wisconsin-based company specializing in student information systems. 
            In this role, I am involved in full-stack .NET development, overseeing crucial backend operations for the 
            company's primary software product. As part of my responsibilities, I have strengthened my skills in web development, 
            database management, REST APIs, server administration, and service-oriented architecture. 
            My daily toolkit primarily consists of C#, SQL, and Powershell as I work on service calls and projects to
            improve visibility and development speed company-wide. Per my manager: "We wouldn't get anything done without you, and
            that's not an exaggeration."
        </p>

            I have a natural affinity for coding and diving into complex processes. 
            Given my academic background in computer science and mathematics, combined with a lifelong personal interest in financial markets,
            I am actively exploring career opportunities in stock market software development or quantitative analysis.
            I thrive on immersing myself in intricate projects and solving problems efficiently.
            I am excited to leverage my skills to contribute to the field and
            discover new opportunities throughout my professional journey.
