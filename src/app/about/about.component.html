        <p>
            I am a software engineer with a background in computer science and mathematics, currently focused on opportunities 
            in New York City. I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 
            where I combined a strong technical foundation with leadership roles across campus organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Professionally, I've worked in production engineering environments spanning platform engineering, 
            internal tooling, and web application development. My experience includes building and maintaining 
            .NET-based backend systems, automating CI/CD pipelines, developing tools used by hundreds of developers, 
            and supporting security validation and remediation efforts in production environments. 
            I'm particularly interested in work at the intersection of engineering execution, risk management, and business outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of purely technical roles, I have led large, cross-functional teams in non-technical environments. 
            As a director of Humorology, UW-Madison's annual Greek philanthropic theater production, 
            I coordinated over 100 students and helped raise more than $400,000 for Wisconsin charities. 
            I have also worked in the public sector as a Legislative Intern at the Wisconsin State Capitol, 
            supporting policy research and constituent services across a range of complex issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am drawn to roles that require structured problem-solving, clear communication, and ownership 
            from concept through delivery. I am focused on opportunities in technology consulting 
            and software engineering, with a long-term interest in technical leadership and management. 
            Outside of work, I enjoy weightlifting, golf, and reading.
