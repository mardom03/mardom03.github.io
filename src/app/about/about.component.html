        <p>
            I am a software engineer and technology consultant focused on opportunities in New York City, 
            with a background in computer science, mathematics, and large-scale platform development. 
            I recently graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics, 
            where I combined a strong technical foundation with leadership roles across campus organizations.

            Alongside my academic work, I spent several years in production engineering roles spanning platform engineering and 
            web application development, with exposure to security validation in production environments. I built and maintained 
            .NET-based backend systems, automated CI/CD pipelines, developed internal tooling supporting hundreds of developers, 
            and supported web application vulnerability remediation efforts. I am particularly interested in work at the intersection 
            of engineering execution, risk management, and business outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my technical work, I have led large, cross-functional teams in non-technical environments. 
            As a director of Humorology, UW-Madison's annual Greek philanthropic theater production, 
            I coordinated over 100 students and helped raise more than $400,000 for Wisconsin charities. 
            I have also worked in public-sector environments as a Legislative Intern at the Wisconsin State Capitol, 
            supporting policy research and constituent services across a range of complex issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am drawn to roles that require structured problem-solving, clear communication, and ownership 
            from concept through delivery. Professionally, I am focused on opportunities in technology consulting 
            and software engineering, with a long-term interest in technical leadership and management. 
            Outside of work, I enjoy weightlifting, golf, and reading.
        </p>
